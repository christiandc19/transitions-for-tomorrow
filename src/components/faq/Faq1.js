      <div class="accordion-body">
        <p>The admissions process starts with a brief phone intake with one of our trained recovery admission specialists. During this time, we will verify benefits with the client’s insurance company. The second step is a 30-minute evaluation with one of our clinical staff. Once we have clinical approval for admission and can verify benefits, we will schedule an appointment for a virtual document signing. Our goal is to make this a quick and comfortable process for the client starting their journey in recovery.</p>

After you have completed a phone evaluation and received an overview of the Aware program, an admissions team member will work with you to schedule a time for your virtual document signing and initial assessments. Upon completion of the signing, treatment will officially begin and the first home visit will be scheduled. Aware will work with you and your schedule to get you into treatment as soon as possible. </p>

When using insurance, individuals engaged in Aware Recovery Care may be responsible for copays or deductibles depending on their insurance plan. Each insurance plan is different; however, admissions will be able to explain the coverage and costs associated with care. If you have questions about coverage, please call our admissions department’s client care specialists, who will walk you through coverage and cost.

        We also have a private pay option, billed at an affordable monthly rate. Our private pay option does not require a yearlong commitment. Our admissions staff will work closely with you on a month-to-month basis if this payment option is feasible for you.</p>

        <p>Aware Recovery Care’s statistically proven model is designed to be a 52-week, in-home program. Research conducted with Yale University shows that treatment that runs for an entire year has a significantly higher success rate than programs with shorter courses of treatment. While we recommend that everyone engage in the program for the full 52 weeks, that may not be a viable option for all. Clients do not need to commit to a full year of treatment and have the option to engage monthly. However, we have found that although they are not required, most opt to complete the entire year of treatment.</p>

{/* FAQ 6 */}
<div class="accordion-item">

    </h2>
    <div id="collapseSix" class="accordion-collapse collapse" data-bs-parent="#accordionExample">
      <div class="accordion-body">
        <p>A typical day will consist of a one-hour visit with a member of your care team; a Care Coordinator, one of the two Client Recovery Advisors (CRA), or a telehealth video visit with your Internal Psychotherapist (IPT). Most of our visits are in person, in your home or the community. The Care Coordinator will coordinate and manage your care by connecting you to a Primary Care Physician, local Psychiatrist, specialized therapists, or medical specialists. If you currently have existing providers, the Care Coordinator will collaborate with them on your care, as well as help you navigate the behavioral health and medical landscape. <br /><br />

        Your CRA will deliver a biopsychosocial curriculum focusing on where you are on your recovery journey. Each intervention is designed specifically to engage and educate about the disease of addiction. You will receive random Urine Drug Screens (or UDS) from your treatment team for increased accountability. However, UDS results are never punitive. <br /><br />

        CRAs are free to conduct most visits outside the home as well. Popular options include going for a hike while covering the day’s intervention, achieving one of your community goals, introducing you to a local support meeting, or working on the curriculum before or after the meeting. This format allows our clients to experience new, fun activities to do sober with a CRA for the first time, while helping them engage with a support fellowship if they choose to. <br /><br />

        On certain days, your IPT will offer telehealth therapy around your substance use disorder and help you build coping skills to manage daily triggers and stress. In addition, a Family Education Facilitator will provide support and education to your identified family members about the disease of addiction from a family perspective. </p>

        <p>Aware Recovery Care delivers an intensive, In-Home Addiction Treatment program for individuals seeking recovery from alcohol, opioids, or other substances. Aware helps people “Recover Where You Live” with an emphasis on the home or transitional living environment, unique family dynamic, and the broader community. Each client receives direct care from a Psychiatric provider, Care Coordinator (Nurse, Social Worker), Family Education Facilitator, Licensed Individual Therapist, Licensed Family Therapist, and two Client Recovery Advisors who meet with them in their homes around their schedules for up to a year. The core team addresses the medical, emotional, and mental health issues required to maintain sobriety and achieve recovery.<br /><br />


        Our clients receive daily guidance from the multidisciplinary team while engaging in a structured, 52-week bio-psycho-social curriculum. The Psychiatric Provider evaluates the client for any underlying mental health issues and, when appropriate, utilizes medication. While the Care Coordinator (Nurse, Social Worker) helps the client coordinate care and navigate the medical landscape, the Licensed Family Therapist works with the family unit to strengthen the support system and increase accountability for the client. And our Client Recovery Advisors (peer support) assist the client in navigating the available support structures in the community.<br /><br />


        This patient-centered, medically integrated, in-home addiction treatment program is designed to ensure lasting recovery and to prevent recurrence and re-admission to higher levels of care. Aware makes it possible for our clients to receive longer-term addiction care while maintaining their privacy and meeting their day-to-day responsibilities, such as work, school, and family. </p>

        <p>All clients receive a psychiatric evaluation with one of Aware’s pre-approved community-based providers within the first two weeks of treatment. We will ensure that the provider is in-network with your insurance so you can continue services if you and the physician deem it appropriate. You and your provider will determine how often you meet after receiving the psychiatric evaluation. If you already have a psychiatrist and do not wish to change providers, you will be encouraged to remain with that provider. At no point will you be asked to change any of your current providers. If you are unhappy with your provider or wish to switch providers at any point in treatment, your Care Coordinator will work with you to identify a provider you feel comfortable with. </p>

        <p>Research shows us that individuals with family involvement during treatment have much higher rates of prolonged abstinence and success in recovery. Aware also recognizes that “family” extends beyond the nuclear family. Our goal is to help you identify positive supports in your life and help create or strengthen a recovery network. These individuals may be parents, siblings, spouses, neighbors, coworkers, or friends – whoever you would like to be a part of your treatment. We connect our clients and their families/allies with a Family Systems Therapy professional. These licensed Family Systems providers are chosen based on location, specialty, and other preferences. <br /><br />

        Engaging in Family Systems Therapy allows for healing, change, and growth within the family. Participation can include the client, his or her allies in the recovery process, and/or any and all family members. <br /><br />

        Family Wellness does NOT focus on your treatment (facilitators will not discuss what you are doing in session or comment on your progress, and will not answer any treatment-related questions about you). Rather, Family Wellness focuses on essential topics such as the biology of addiction, healthy boundaries, and effective communication. This allows the family to get a better understanding of what their loved one is experiencing and also enables them to begin their own healing. Our treatment approach is rooted in the idea that when one person in a family shifts toward wellness, everyone else in the family also takes a healthy turn.</p>
