                Watching someone you love disappear into addiction is terrifying. Families and friends of individuals struggling with substance use disorder may feel exhausted, traumatized, isolated, and grief-stricken. <br/><br/>

                Often, going away to treatment seems like a solution—because the addicted person won’t be able to access their drug of choice and will have distance from life stressors and triggers. But once they’re back home, without support to apply what they’ve learned in real life, staying abstinent is not easy.<br/><br/>

                At Aware, we walk the path with you. Treatment starts in the home and stays in the home, so your recovering friend or family member can stay on course.
