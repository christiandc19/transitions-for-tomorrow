                <p>Our goal is to support the self-development and successful reintegration of the formerly incarcerated through the mentorship and living example of other formerly incarcerated participants, faculty, and staff. Transitioning for Tomorrow has developed a life-affirming alternative to the revolving door policies of mass incarceration by providing housing and employment services more accessible and supportive of the formerly incarcerated. We strive to assist participants to acquire the knowledge and skills needed to obtain self-sufficiency through the enhancement of their capacity for civic engagement, community leadership by securing meaningful and gratifying employment that will empower themselves, their families, which will create stronger and safer communities.</p>
